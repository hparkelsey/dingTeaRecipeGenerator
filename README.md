# dingTeaRecipeGenerator
Object-oriented Python script to output the recipe for any Ding Tea menu item to replace the tedious process of having to flip through a recipe book. 

Used super classes to represent all teas, sub classes to represent groups of teas, and objects to represent individual menu items.

Simply input the name of the drink, ice and sugar levels, size, and number of toppings for a detailed formula on how to concoct the drink.
